Toontown
=================
Toontown is a free, non-profit game inspired by _Disney's Toontown Online_.

This source runs on Python3 with a modified version of Panda3D that requires upgraded Py3 Astron code, see dependencies below.


### Our Goal ###
The idea behind this project is to restore Toontown Online to its **original state**. This means that the plan is to removing all modifications Toontown Infinite had planned for the gameplay, as well as restoring all broken features from Toontown Online, excluding the Toon News feature. Feel free to fork this repository if you desire to add your own content.

All changes, except for emergency bug fixes, should be done in either a separate branch, or a fork -- **not** to the master or release branches.

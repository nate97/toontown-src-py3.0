Toontown
=================
Toontown is a free, non-profit game inspired by _Disney's Toontown Online_.


### Our Goal ###
The idea behind this project is to restore Toontown Online to its **original state**. This means that the plan is to removing all modifications Toontown Infinite had planned for the gameplay, as well as restoring all broken features from Toontown Online, excluding the Toon News feature. Feel free to fork this repository if you desire to add your own content.

### Contributing ###
Don't just start contributing. We talk about what we are about to do before we do it! All changes, except for emergency bug fixes, should be done in either a separate branch, or a fork -- **not** to the master or release branches. When you are ready to merge your changes, submit a _pull request_ for review.
